# Triangle Tester

##### This app tests if a shape is or is not a triangle, August 17, 2015.

#### By **Diana Holland**

## Description

You may enter the dimensions of your shape and this app will tell you whether it is isosceles, scalene, equilateral, or not a triangle.

Known bug: This app does not yet recognize that any triangle that meets the above requirements, but has two sides that add to less than the third side, is in fact not a triangle.

## Setup

* You'll need the JDK
* And Gradle or some other way to run and compile
* You'll also need Spark and Velocity
* Get the files and have fun!

## Technologies Used

This app is written in Java with a little help from Bootstrap.
